    <h2>HBO-ICT and why I think this course is for me</h2>
    <article>
    <p>After careful evaluation of other courses of study, no other programme really suited my interest like ICT did!</p>
    <p>It is a course/programme that focuses on a more practical learning approach and that really appealed to me. I also love the fact that ICT professionals deal with everyday problems and issues in the world of technology and I do love myself a challenge. For example, we where given two weeks to make a website using HTML and little CSS, despite most of us not having any knowledge of the aforementioned. We where taught with practical lessons and assignments that guided us on how to go about it and I find it very challenging and interesting!</p>
