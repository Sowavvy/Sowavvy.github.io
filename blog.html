    <h3>Feedback from Who am I</h3>
    <p class="max width">Hello Osose, welcome to the program! After reading your "who am I" document I have a few question pointers I want to mention. You don't have to answer them here. Just keep my feedback in mind for your website and personal development. 
        Good to read about your reasons for choosing a study in IT. I am curious which part of IT interests you so much? Also why did you choose this specific study? There are lots of other IT related studies to choose from.
        You also write about your preference for practical studies instead of the more theoretical. This fits our program because we focus a lot on the practical aspects of IT. Of course there is some necessary theory in there especially in the first year. But know that a big part of our study is being part of a team and working on real projects.
        For your carreer choice you don't have to worry yet. You still have a few years to think about what you want to do after the study. The nice thing is that during the study you will learn a lot about the field of IT. This will help you make an informed decision later on.</p>

    <h3>My response to the feedback</h3>
    <p class="max width"> IT has a lot of interesting parts and aspects like software and hardware development, Data Annalysis, Website development (Like what I am doing now) and a lot others. I have done a lot pf thinking and I have realised that the thing that fascinates me the most about IT is hardware engineering. The theory about how a computer is made and what it consists of, how, different softwares are programmed to make the hardware function properly, how different components are put together into a simple design to make an extreemely complex machine. These things, I have come to realise is the reason why ICT is so fascinating to me. </p>

    <h3>My programming experience</h3>
    <p class="max width">Prior to joining the HBO-ICT course at HZ University, I had little to no programming experience. I took up some courses at freecodecamp a few years ago on kthe programming language C+, but I fell off few days later due to it being abit complex and I do not cope as well learning on my own as I do in a class or in a one to one lecture.</p>
