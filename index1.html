    <h3>About myself</h3>
    <p class="max-width">My name is Eromonsele Excel Osose, I was born in Benin City, a city in Southern Nigeria to a Nigerian father and a British mother. My main hobies include gaming, listening to music and hanging out with friends. I came to the Netherlands on march 7th this year, I was previously in Ukraine studying, and had to leave because of the war. To cut a long story short, I am here to continue my education and get a Degree in one of the best countries in the world. I play games and go out with friends in my spare time. I enjoy listening to music, especially Afrobeats and Drill. I enjoy cycling on ebikes because of how incredibly fast they are and I like the adrenaline I get from them, I would definitely buy one if people would just get their own bikes instead of stealing. I'm not the best at making friends but I do enjoy good company.</p>
    <h3>Why ICT</h3>
    <p class="max-width">After careful evaluation of other courses of study, no other programme really suited my interest like ICT did!
        It is a course that focuses on a more practical learning approach and that really appealed to me. I also love the fact that ICT professionals deal with everyday problems and issues in the world of technology and I do love myself a challenge. For example, we where given two weeks to make a website using HTML and little CSS, despite most of us not having any knowledge of the aforementioned. We where taught with practical lessons and assignments that guided us on how to go about it and I find it very challenging and interesting. </p>
