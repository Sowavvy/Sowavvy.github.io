    <h3>What is motivation</h3>
    <p class="max width">Motivation is what prompts a person  to perform certain behavior, in humans motivation is mainly about the initiation, direction, commitment and persistence of the behavior. Motivation arises from the combination of innate and cultural characteristics of the individual.
        Furthermore, rewards have a lot of influence on the motivation to do something or to perform something. Research has shown that positive results and rewards have a lot of influence on motivation and that there appears to be more motivation than when there are negative results and rewards.</p>
    <h3>Performance</h3>
    <p class="max width">I took a performance motivation test. From which the result below came

        You are highly extrinsically motivated and fairly intrinsically motivated. The fact that you are strongly extrinsically motivated means that you find it very important what you can achieve with your studies. You do your best at school/in your studies because you want to earn a lot of money later, have social status and/or want to get recognition from people. In itself it is very good to dwell on such things. After all, you do not live in social isolation and you will soon have to earn your own living. The fact that you are fairly intrinsically motivated means that you also enjoy studying. But you don't like it very much. For you, the result of your study is more important than your study itself.
        
        I agree with the result. This is because I can identify with what it says very well, such as that I quite enjoy studying, but not too much, I notice this myself.
        It is also true that the result of my study is more important than the study itself. This was also the case with my previous study, then my only motivation was what I could earn with it and not whether it was also a study for me.</p>
    <h3>My motivation towards computer Science</h3>
    <p class="max width">I really like to be able to know how to program complex problems that others cant
        It gives me a sense of accomplishment to be able to know that I can do stuff that other people find quite difficult like buildinf this nice website (By my standard)</p>
    <h3>My motivation to study</h3>
    <p class="max width">I want to study so that I can get a good degree, I want to study so that I can get a good paying job and be able to provide for myself, my family and my loved ones, I want to make my parents proud and finally let them know that I am a responsible man. But overall, I want to be proud of myself, I want to look at myself after 5 years and reflect on the past and say yes, I finally did it!</p>
